# ML-on-Graphs
 
-  This repository is an aggregated list of resources that one can use if interested in Machine Learning on Graphs.
-  This will keep getting updated as and when I come across some new(or maybe old but missed) resources.
-  Resources which you feel I may have missed and should be here, please post as Issues.

## Books
1. [Graph Representation Learning Book](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/): One of the best available book on Graph ML, covering topics from graph basics to traditional graph learning methods to GNN and more.
## Lectures
1. [CS224W Stanford Course on Machine Learning with Graphs](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) : This is the 2021 course. 2022 course videos are awaited. The youtube playlist of the video leactures can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAB_plj2rbA&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn)

## Videos and Blogs
1. [Introduction to Graph Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCEYiCxrL_0): A 2019 talk from Microsoft Research.
2. [Intro to graph neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8owQBFAHw7E&t=567s): A fantastic video by Petar Veličković, from DeepMind, on GNNs.
3. [Graph Powered Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrT9AW464go): Video from databricks on machine learning with Graphs.
4. [Graph Neural Nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFLeKkXWq2c&list=PLBoQnSflObckArGNhOcNg7lQG_f0ZlHF5): A youtube playlist, from wonderful Aleksa Gordić, on various Graph ML topics.
5. [Graph Convolutional Networks](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/): A slightly old but still relevant blog by none other than Dr. Thomas Kipf himself, on what GCN is.

## Papers
